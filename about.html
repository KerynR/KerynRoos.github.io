                    Hi...My name is Keryn!
                </h1> 
            </div>
                      
                <p>
                    I am a 23 year old, final year B.Sc Information Technology student at the North West University, Vaal Triangle Campus.
                    <br><br>
                    I am a hardworking individual and I am passionate about learning all things IT. 
                    I especially enjoy working with Databases as well as the design and User Interface aspects.
                    <br><br>
                    During my last 2 years of studying, I have been a Student Assistant for various modules. 
                    These include Python, C++, C#, and  Java.
                    I have thoroughly enjoyed helping other students hands-on and have found the experience to be very rewarding. 
                    It has also helped me to cement the knowledge and experience I gained when I took the modules myself.
                    <br><br>
                    Prior to studying, I completed courses in MS Excel, Word and PowerPoint with LearnFast.
                    In addition to the skills learned in my current degree, I have also done multiple Udemy and Codecademy Courses. 
                    <br><br>
                    Once I have completed my B.Sc in Information Technology in 2020, I plan on completing my Honors degree full-time in 2021. 
                    By completing my honors degree, I hope that it will allow me to gain a further understanding of the components relating to the IT world in a more specialized manner.
